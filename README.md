# New-Year-Countdown

This is a simple new year countdown website that I made to try web programming. 

If it's within the first 7 days into the new year, the website will display a celebratory 'happy new year' sign, flash the new year number, and play some music. 

Otherwise, there is a live countdown timer in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. If the time remaining of the year is less than 1 day/hour/minute, that parameter will not be displayed in the countodwn.
